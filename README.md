#### Analysis of the soil nematode communities and nematode-bacteria co-occurrence networks

#### Data type: Miseq 18S amplicon sequencing data
###### Note 1: The samples have been randomly sequenced in multiple sequencing runs.
###### Note 2: The present analyses have been performed on demultiplexed sequence data processed using Qiime II and DADA2.

#### Steps of data analysis:
- Quality control, denoising and cleaning data (nematode and bacteria samples)
- Explanatory analysis 
- Faunal analysis (soil food web, based on [NINJA] (https://shiny.wur.nl/ninja/) results)
- Network analysis (nematode-bacteria co-occurrence network)
